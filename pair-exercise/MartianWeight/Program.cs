    In case you've ever pondered how much you weight on Mars, here's the calculation:
    Wm = We* 0.378
    where 'Wm' is the weight on Mars, and 'We' is the weight on Earth

    Write a command line program which accepts a series of Earth weights from the user  
    and displays each Earth weight as itself, and its Martian equivalent.


    C:\Users> MartianWeight  
    Enter a series of Earth weights (space-separated): 98 235 185

    98 lbs.on Earth, is 37 lbs.on Mars.
    235 lbs.on Earth, is 88 lbs.on Mars.
    185 lbs.on Earth, is 69 lbs.on Mars.
